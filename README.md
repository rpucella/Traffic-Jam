# Traffic Jam

*Traffic Jam* is an implementation of a physical board game sometimes called *Rush Hour*. 

Honestly, this is just a testbed for me to explore new front-end technologies.


## NodeJS version

A NodeJS version of the game can be found in the `node-version` directory. You'll need *NodeJS* and *npm*. 

To install, run *npm install* (which will install the necessary NodeJS packages).

To run, run *npm start*.



## React version

A version of the game that runs in a browser, using Facebook's React UI framework. Currently under development. 

To run, just open `tf.html` with your browser.
